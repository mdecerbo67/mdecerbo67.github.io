<p><indent>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Matthew De Cerbo. I grew up in the Hudson Valley. Having attended in the Newburgh School District, I have had an enlarged love for music.
I have been part of several All District music festival and have been in part with All County music festival. I proceed to play the tuba daily in the school band
since elementary grades. I have had the privilege to have had written a piece of music that our school band could perform. My dream is to become a music teacher
and educate people about music. Also to encourage people to enter the realm of music, teaching that expression is best made through music.
